With an intention to create an online community of practice, we came up with Crisp – a beautifully-
designed responsive theme based on Bootstrap for Moodle 2.5.1 and above.

Crisp is designed to provide a more specialized and clean website, its based on the Crisp Bootstrap 

Theme. Following the recent trend of making Moodle more visually appealing we have coded this theme 

to offer a very different Moodle experience. As the name suggests, the theme is Crisp and clear with a 

very dynamic Front page.

 Here is a list of things that you can do with this theme and get the perfect Moodle website you have 

always yearned for:

1. You can access the menu/page list from the front page of your website. The list can be seen on 

the extreme right hand side of the page.

2. You will be able to enter Blog/Support, Course and Forum pages from the home page itself 

through three separate icons at the bottom that link to these respective pages. 

3. From the settings panel, you can change the title of your site, which will appear just below the 

slider. 

4. There is separate field in the theme to let you describe your website. Fill it out with descriptions, 

information, updates and plans relating to the website that you want your users to know about.

5. On the menu list, you will find “Groups”. These are basically the categories for Moodle courses 

your site offers. From the View tab, you can visit pages where courses relating to these 

categories are properly described and can be accessed.

6. You can show the images used in each blog posts in fancybox.

7. The side-blocks in this theme are docked and these can be seen by clicking the Home icon.
